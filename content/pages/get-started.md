## What is OCW?

OCW is a free and open publication of material from thousands of MIT courses, covering the entire MIT curriculum. That's every MIT department and degree program, ranging from the introductory to the most advanced graduate level. Each OCW course includes a syllabus, some instructional material (such as lecture notes or a reading list), and some learning activities (such as assignments or exams). Many courses also have [complete video lectures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/audio-video-courses/?__hstc=215508872.8b0d6a564d954ec36735e5f3e5a4d717.1644420099739.1648738214719.1648749631544.13&__hssc=215508872.1.1648749631544&__hsfp=689994695), [free online textbooks](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/online-textbooks/?__hstc=215508872.8b0d6a564d954ec36735e5f3e5a4d717.1644420099739.1648738214719.1648749631544.13&__hssc=215508872.1.1648749631544&__hsfp=689994695), and [faculty teaching insights](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/this-course-at-mit/?__hstc=215508872.8b0d6a564d954ec36735e5f3e5a4d717.1644420099739.1648738214719.1648749631544.13&__hssc=215508872.1.1648749631544&__hsfp=689994695).

## For Teachers

The free materials on OCW are used by educators around the world in teaching, adapted and integrated into curricula that inspires and empowers learners. And by sharing MIT faculty’s teaching approaches with the world, OCW is also a setting for reflective dialog about the craft of teaching and using Open Educational Resources (OER).

We encourage you to start exploring OCW's [Educator Initiative page](https://ocwnext.odl.mit.edu/educator/?__hstc=215508872.8b0d6a564d954ec36735e5f3e5a4d717.1644420099739.1648738214719.1648749631544.13&__hssc=215508872.10.1648749631544&__hsfp=689994695) that includes content created and curated just for educators.

**Why doesn't every MIT OpenCourseWare course offer video lectures?**

We know that video lectures are important. In recent years, OCW has substantially increased its video content. However, the high cost of video production means we can only provide video for some of the courses we publish. Your [financial support](https://ocw.mit.edu/donate?__hstc=215508872.8b0d6a564d954ec36735e5f3e5a4d717.1644420099739.1648738214719.1648749631544.13&__hssc=215508872.14.1648749631544&__hsfp=689994695) can help fund more video content.

**Can you suggest a sequence of courses to study?**

To see what courses MIT requires for its degree programs, refer to the [MIT curriculum guide](https://mitocw.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4938917523611) and individual [department and program websites](https://web.mit.edu/education/schools-and-departments/?__hstc=215508872.8b0d6a564d954ec36735e5f3e5a4d717.1644420099739.1648738214719.1648749631544.13&__hssc=215508872.14.1648749631544&__hsfp=689994695). Please note that OCW cannot offer degrees or course credit.

**How do I get a copy of the course pack or readings for a particular course?**

The course packs or reading materials used in many MIT courses contain proprietary and copyrighted work that MIT faculty and students are only permitted to use within their classrooms. OCW cannot provide these materials under our license. Your local library may be able to help you find free copies of these works.

## About the MIT Curriculum Guide

While OCW doesn’t grant credit, certificates, or degrees for learning with our material, we know that understanding how the MIT curriculum is structured can be very helpful in using OCW.

Most of the material shared on MIT OpenCourseWare comes directly from the MIT curriculum, from courses taken by enrolled students. On OCW, you’re often seeing the very same content used by enrolled MIT students as they work toward their degrees.

For example, some of OCW’s most popular material comes from courses that satisfy MIT’s undergraduate degree General Institute Requirements (GIRs) for the [*Science Core*](https://firstyear.mit.edu/academics-exploration/general-institute-requirements-girs/science-core/?__hstc=215508872.8b0d6a564d954ec36735e5f3e5a4d717.1644420099739.1648738214719.1648749631544.13&__hssc=215508872.16.1648749631544&__hsfp=689994695)—six foundational courses across biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. Each of these requirements can be satisfied by related but varied treatments to match one’s particular interests and level of preparation. There is more than one way to learn these key concepts, and so, on OCW you’ll find some of the varied treatments offered at MIT.
