This page will help you begin to learn programming and computer science, with some suggested introductory courses on OCW. Choose from:

- [General Introductions to Programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/intro-programming/#general)
- [Language-Specific Courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/intro-programming/#language)
- [Follow-up Courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/intro-programming/#followup)

 

## **General Introductions to Programming**

These courses introduce principles of computer science and begin to develop programming skills, specifically in the Python language. Learn more about these courses’ learning goals, history and student experience in this [MIT news article](https://news.mit.edu/2018/class-computer-science-programming-python-0504).
